ELDR Project



Over three-quarters of Americans own smartphones and computers, and that number is still on the rise. App developers who don't consider elderly users may be missing a crucial segment of possible consumers.

We chose this project because we notice that many elderly people are savvy smartphone users. They check emails directly from the device, connect with friends and relatives through mobile messaging apps, like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger, play games, read books, and more.

“What can be done to make interactions with mobile apps easier for older users?”
Our app is more for elderly community members that rely on smartphones or computers for communication, information gathering, 
In the project we tried to make easy and simple for elderly people, some easy factors we consider in the design process include: contrast, labels, formatting, navigation, and cues.

1. Increase the Contrast Between Text & Background
2. Label Icons to Avoid Miscommunication
3. Format Fonts, Icons & Interactive Elements with the User In Mind
4. Avoid Complex Navigational Elements
5. Images and videos.
